# Hard Hats
Hard Hats is an Android application that was created for a student senior project at Farmingdale State College. Included in this repository are the HTML and CSS code that was written for the purpose of the project by me.

The Android application code can be found at https://github.com/adamdanielsen/HardHats and was primarily written by Adam Danielsen, Evan Esatto, and Jonathan Cucuzza.
